% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{psfrag}



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, the problem of distributed radio resource assignment in wireless networks is defined as a Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) problem \cite{duffy2011dcs}. A protocol to allocate channel slots to contending stations in a multiple access scenario is used as the reference example. A particular solver that iteratively uses a stochastic search until it converges to a solution is considered. The convergence process of the solver is modeled by an absorbing Markov chain (MC), and analytical, closed-form expressions for its transition probabilities are derived. The expected number of steps required to reach a solution is found by calculating the MC's expected number of steps to absorption. The analysis is validated by means of simulations and the model is extended to account for the presence of channel errors.

%\boldmath
%In this paper we use a Markov Chain to model a simple solver for Decentralized Constrain Satisfaction problems.
%We provide closed-form expressions to compute the transition probabilities and the transition probabilities matrix can then be used to determine the expected number of steps that the system requires to converge to a solution.
%We use a protocol to allocate channel slots to contending stations as an illustrating example, and extend our model to contemplate the possibility of channel errors.
%The model is validated by means of simulation and we show that it can be easily extended to account for the presence of errors.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

% \IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper we discuss a family of protocols that can be used for radio resource assignment in wireless networks.
% The problem of assigning resources in a distributed fashion is defined as a Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) problem \cite{duffy2011dcs}.
% We consider a particular solver for this family of problems that works iteratively, in several rounds, to find a solution to the problem.

% The solver performs a stochastic search until it converges to a solution.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

\IEEEPARstart{S}{ince} the inception of wireless local area networks (WLANs), random medium access mechanisms have played a key role in arbitrating the access to the channel. The core principles of the medium access control (MAC) that were introduced in the first release of the IEEE 802.11 standard are still valid today \cite{IEEE80211-IEEESTD2007}. The contending stations use carrier sense to prevent stations from interrupting other transmissions. Slotted time combined with a backoff counter is used to reduce the chances that two stations simultaneously start a transmission. Until today, this backoff counter has been initialized with a random value. Stations separate two transmission attempts by a random backoff, to give the opportunity to other stations to transmit.

Recently, it has been pointed out that the random choice of the backoff value is not necessary after successful transmissions \cite{barcelo2008lba}.
In fact, if all the nodes that have successfully transmitted choose a common deterministic backoff value for their next transmission, the chances of collisions are reduced, since in their next transmission they may only collide with the remaining unsuccessful nodes.
Furthermore, under certain idealistic conditions, a collision-free operation can be reached. 

The idea of using a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions has been later explored in more detail in, e.g., \cite{he2009srb,barcelo2011tcf,fang2011dlm,barcelo2010fcc}. 
The goal of this class of protocols is to distributively build a collision-free schedule which will then repeat periodically. This translates into the decentralized assignment of stations to slots within one period of the schedule in such a way that there is no slot that contains more than one station. 
Nevertheless, similar problems can be found in other areas of networking. Examples are provided in \cite{duffy2011dcs}, where this family of problems is accurately defined and named \emph{Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction} (DCS). 
The same paper also describes a solver and characterizes it by providing a bound that describes the convergence properties of the solver.

We are interested in the convergence process, and in particular in forecasting the expected number of steps required to reach a solution. To this end, an absorbing Markov Chain (MC) model can be used to model the solver. The first contribution of this paper is the derivation of closed-form expressions to compute the transition probabilities of the absorbing MC.
The second contribution is the adaptation of the model to an environment in which errors can occur.


%\AzDel{We will use the convention to say that a slot is successful when there is a single station transmitting in that slot.
%Similarly, we will refer to the station transmitting in the successful slot as a successful station.
%In our analysis, we will be presented with the problem of counting the number of successful slots when $N$ stations choose among $B$ slots.
%The particular case in which all the stations randomly choose the transmission slot has already been addressed in the literature in \cite{szpankowski1983asc}.
%However, in the present paper, we have to consider also the case in which some of the stations choose their transmission slot deterministically while the remaining stations randomly choose their transmission slot.} \AzCom{Not really introduction material. Remove or move elsewhere if needed!}

\AzCom{We are presenting the CSMA stuff as just an example. Therefore, prior work cannot be only on our example but should be on the actual problem, i.e., DCS. We need some references, maybe on CS itself if there are not many on DCS and then highlight that the DCS stuff is recent.}

In the next section, we define the DCS problems, and we will exemplify them by introducing a reference protocol in Sect. \ref{}. The reference protocol constructs a collision-free schedule in a wireless local area network (WLAN) in a distributed fashion. 
The actual absorbing MC model is introduced in Sect. \ref{} where the expressions to compute the transition probabilities are also derived.
These probabilities can be used to compute the expected number of steps required for the system to converge to a solution, as described in Sect. \ref{}.
This section also describes the extension of the model to an environment in which errors (e.g., channel errors) can occur.
To validate the model, we present some numerical results in Sect. \ref{}.
Finally, Sect.\ref{} concludes the paper.

\section{Related Work}

\cite{checco2012scs}

The random assignment of channel resources to wireless stations or letting the stations choose among one of the possible resources appears repeatedly in the literature (e.g., \cite{szpankowski1983asc}, \cite{kartsakli2011tmd}).
Obviously, it may happen that the same resource is assigned to more than one station.
When a resource is assigned to more than one station, we refer to it as a collision.
And we call those stations that do not collide successful stations.
The probability of obtaining $\delta$ successes given $N$ stations and $B$ resources is computed in \cite{szpankowski1983asc}.

Recently, the initial idea of letting the stations randomly select one of the possible resources has been enhanced to contemplate several rounds (See \cite{fang2011} and references therein).
In a first round, the stations randomly choose one of the possible resources.
Those stations that succeed stick to the chosen resource while the stations that collide randomly choose one of the possible resources again.
At some point, if the number of stations is not larger than the number of resources, a solution is reached in which each of the stations has its own resource and there are no collisions.

The assignment of channel resources to wireless stations is just an instance of a decentralized constraint satisfaction problem \cite{duffy2011dcs}.
And the solution described above is an instance of a decentralized constraint satisfaction problem solver, which provably finds a solution in finite time and exhibits a performance comparable to well known constraint satisfaction problem solvers such as WalkSAT \cite{}.


\section{Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction}
\label{sec:dcs}
A Constraint Satisfaction problem with $N$ variables is defined as follows (adopting the notation from \cite{duffy2011dcs}).
We consider $N$ variables,  \mbox{$\mathbf{x} := (x_1,\dots,x_N)$}, with $x_i \in \mathbf{B}=\left\{1, \dots, B \right\}, \forall i $, and $M$ clauses, $\left\{ \Phi_1(\mathbf{x}),\dots,\Phi_M(\mathbf{x}) \right\}$, that are boolean functions.
The $M$ clauses represent the constraints and take a value equal to 1 if the constraint is satisfied and 0 otherwise.
An assignment $\mathbf{x}$ is a solution to the problem if all the constraints are satisfied.

While there are solvers for this kind of problem, they are typically centralized \AzCom{references?}, i.e., assuming that the solver has the complete information about all variables. In communication networks, however, this assumption normally does not hold. Examples are often encountered in the area of wireless networks, e.g., wireless sensor or mesh networks, where nodes typically function in the absense of any centralized control. Hence, it is necessary to find solvers that can solve the constraint satisfaction problem in a decentralized manner. 

\Az{A Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) solver \AzCom{The problem is the same one defined above and is not decentralized, the solver is. We should fix this throughout the paper. Also, it may be better to use the same acronym as Duffy (decentralized CSP)} chooses the value of a variable $x_i$ at every step, based on only a single bit of information that indicates whether or not the clauses in which $x_i$ participates were satisfied in the previous step. In other words, the decision is based solely on whether those clauses whose values are affected by $x_i$ were all satisfied in the previous step, or there is at least one of them that has not been satisfied.} 

A DCS solver is presented in \cite{duffy2011dcs} that searches for a solution of the problem using an iterative approach. The solver learns from previous mistakes in order to increase the chances of reaching a solution in the next step. In the first step, the variables take one of the possible values with equal probability. Then the clauses are evaluated and this information is used to determine the probabilities for the assignments of values to the variables in the next round.
The solver uses two different parameters, $a$ and $b$, to adjust the learning process.
An attractive property of this decentralized solver is that it reaches the solution in finite time, if it exists, and its performance is comparable to the known centralized solvers.

To illustrate how the constraint satisfaction problem maps to practical scenarios, we will briefly cover two examples. First, the assignment of frequency channels to WLAN access points and, second, the assignment of time slots to contending wireless stations in a WLAN, which we will use as our reference scenario.
The first example consists in a set of WLAN access points that need to select the channels they use in a distributed fashion. Since the access points that are close to one another may interfere with each other's communication, but may not be able to communicate directly with each other, this presents a DCS problem. Here variable $x_i$ indicates the channel for access point $i$, chosen from the set of available channels $\mathbf{B}$. There is one clause per every pair of access points in each other's interference range, indicating whether they have selected the same channel or not.

\section{The Reference Scenario}

The second example, and our reference scenario, is the distributed assignment of $N$ contending wireless stations to $B$ channel time slots. 
In each slot a single transmission can be completed and acknowledged. 
From a station's perspective, there are two possible outcomes for every transmission.
The station succeeds if no other station is assigned the same slot. 
A successful transmission is acknowledged within the same slot in which the transmission has taken place.
If at least one other station picks the same slot, all stations involved will suffer a collision, and the transmission is unsuccessful, in which case no acknowledgement will be received.


For this example, the variables $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$ in the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem are the slots chosen by the $N$ contending wireless stations from the set of available slots $\mathbf{B}$. Again, there is one clause per pair of variables evaluating if they have the same value or not. The clause will return 0 if the two participating stations have selected the same slot (i.e., collision) and returns 1 otherwise.

\section{The Reference Protocol}

In this section, we describe a protocol that distributively solves the problem posed in the previous section, whenever a solution exists. The contention is organized in transmission rounds that contain $B$ transmission slots. In every round, each of the $N$ stations transmit exactly once. A solution to the problem is an assignment in which there is no slot containing more than one wireless stations. The protocol describes how the stations pick their transmission slots in each of the transmission rounds, taking into account that each station is only aware of the outcome of its own transmission in the previous round.

The protocol works as follows. In the first round, each station randomly and independently picks one of the $B$ possible slots in the round. If the transmission is successful, the station will pick exactly the same slot in the next round. Otherwise, it will pick one of the $B$ slots in the next time randomly. This process repeats until all stations successfully transmit in the same round, from which point on, all the stations will transmit periodically and no collisions will occur. The operation of this protocol is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:csma_eca_compact} for five consecutive rounds. In this example, a collision-free solution is reached in the fourth round, after which the same schedule can be repeated endlessly without further collisions.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/csma_eca_compact}
  \caption{CSMA/ECA contention}
  \label{fig:csma_eca_compact}
\end{figure}

This protocol is a simplified version of a variant of CSMA/CA, called CSMA with enhanced collision avoidance (CSMA/ECA). A detailed explanation of CSMA/ECA can be found in, e.g., \cite{barcelo2008lba,barcelo2009tpc,he2009srb,fang2011dlm}.

The reference protocol can be viewed as a distributed solver for the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem defined in the previous section. In the first round, the variables $x_i$ are assigned a value in $\{1,\cdots, B \}$ randomly, with probability $1/B$. Then the constraints are evaluated.
Those variables that are involved in constraints that are not satisfied take a random value again in the next round, while the other variables keep the same value as in the previous round.
When a solution is reached, all the variables keep the same value. This solver is, in fact, an instance of the parametrized solver proposed in \cite{duffy2011dcs} with the parameter values set to $a=b=1$.


\section{The Markov Chain Model}
\label{sec:markov_chain}

% With this parametrization, the behavior of the solver is extremely simple.
% In the first step, the variables $x_i$ are assigned a value randomly. Then the constraints are evaluated.
% Those variables that are involved in constraints that are not satisfied take a random value in the next step, while the other variables keep the same value as in the previous step.
% When the solution is reached, all the variables keep the same value.
% \AzDel{This is, e.g., roughly equivalent to the CSMA/ECA protocol described in the previous section.} \Az{This behavior exactly matches that of our reference protocol described in the previous section, in which case when all the stations successfully transmit, a collision-free schedule is reached that is repeated in the following rounds.}

We are interested in calculating the expected number of rounds required to reach a solution. To this end, we construct a Markov chain to model the behavior of the DSC solver and use the reference protocol to explain it in a more tangible manner.
% can be used to estimate the expected number of steps required to reach the solution. To illustrate the solution better, we will use the protocol described in the previous paragraph as the on-going example.
By pigeonhole principle, a solution exists only when $N\leq B$, i.e., when there are at least as many slots in a round as the total number of stations. Considering $N\leq B$ contending stations in the reference protocol, the associated MC model has $N+1$ different states, $S_0, \dots, S_N$.
The system is in state $S_d$ if exactly $d$ stations ($0 \leq d \leq N$) were successful in the previous round and therefore, will deterministically choose their transmission slot in the current round.
From the constraint satisfaction problem perspective, this is equivalent to saying that there are exactly $d$ variables that were not involved in any constraint that was not satisfied in the previous round.

We are interested in the computation of the transition probability, $p_{d,\delta}^{B,N}$ , from one state $S_d$ to another state $S_\delta$, $0 \leq \delta \leq N$. In other words, $p_{d,\delta}^{B,N}$ is the probability of obtaining $\delta$ successful transmissions given $N$ stations and $B$ slots when $d$ of the stations use a deterministically chosen slot while the remaining $N-d$ stations transmit in a randomly chosen slot.

\AzCom{Why not draw the MC?}
Note that the considered MC is an absorbing MC, as $p_{d,\delta}^{B,N}=1$ when both $d$ and $\delta$ are equal to $N$. This is because, once a collision-free schedule is found, the same collision-free schedule is repeated in every subsequent step.
Since the MC is absorbing, the expected number of steps before convergence can be computed if the values of $p_{d,\delta}^{B,N}$ are known \cite{grinstead1997ip}.

\subsection{Calculating the Transition Probabilities}
To calculate the transition probabilities, we number the stations from $1$ to $N$ for convenience and define $A_i$ to be the event that station $i$ succeeds, and the set $\mathbf{A}=\{A_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$ to be the collection of all such events.
These events are partially overlapping since more than one station may successfully transmit. For a given $d$, the transition probability $p_{d,\delta}^{B,N}$ is the probability that exactly $\delta$ out of the $N$ events in $\Abf$ happen. As mentioned before, when $d = N$, the system is in the absorbing state and $p_{d,\delta}^{B,N} = 1$ when $\delta = d$, and it is zero otherwise. When $d<N$, this probability can be calculated applying a generalized version of the inclusion-exclusion principle (see, e.g., the theorem in Sec. IV.3 of \cite{feller1968ipt}) as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Pij}
p^{B,N}_{d,\delta} = \sum_{j=\delta}^{N} (-1)^{j+\delta}\binom{j}{\delta} S(j),
\end{equation}
where $S(j)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:S_j_def}
S(j) = \sum_{\forall \Abf^{j} \subseteq \Abf} \pr{\bigcap_{A_i \in \Abf^{j}} A_i}.
\end{equation}
Here $\Abf^{j}$ denotes a subset of $\Abf$ that has exactly $j$ elements, i.e., $|\mathbf{A}^{j}|=j$. Therefore, $\pr{\bigcap_{A_i \in \Abf^{j}} A_i}$ is the probability that all the $j$ stations represented in $\Abf^{j}$  successfully transmit. Note that $S(j)$ is a sum of probabilities, but it is not itself a probability. An intuitive explanation of (\ref{eq:Pij}) is presented in Appendix \ref{app:incl-excl-thm}.

% denoted hereafter by $P(\Abf^j_{\cap})$
For a given set of $j$ tagged stations in $\Abf^{j}$, the probability $\pr{\bigcap_{A_i \in \Abf^{j}} A_i}$ depends on $k$, the number of deterministic stations within the $j$ tagged stations. The $j$ tagged stations succeed if the $j-k$ random stations among them choose unoccupied slots, and the remaining $N-d-(j-k)$ untagged random stations choose slots that are different from the ones selected by the $j$ tagged stations. The first event occurs with probability $$\binom{B-d}{j-k} \frac{(j-k)!}{B^{j-k}},$$ and the second with probability $$\left(\frac{B-j}{B} \right)^{N-d-(j-k)}.$$
When $j=N$, we have $k=d$, and therefore, there are no untagged random stations, hence the second probability is 1. Consequently, the probability that all of the $j$ stations of $\Abf^{j}$ succeed, given that $k$ of them are deterministic, after some simplification is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:pAkj}
&\pr{\bigcap_{A_i \in \Abf^{j}} A_i} \\
&~~~~~~~~= \left \{ \begin{array}{lr}
    \displaystyle \frac{(B-d)!(B-j)^{N-d-(j-k)}}{\left(B-d-(j-k)\right)!~B^{N-d}}, & j < N \\&\\
    \displaystyle \frac{(B-d)!}{(B-N)!~B^{N-d}}, & j = N
\end{array}
\right. \nonumber 
\end{align}

For any given $j$, there are $\binom{d}{k} \binom{N-d}{j-k}$ sets $\Abf^{j}$ with $k$ deterministic stations. Furthermore, the number of deterministic stations, $k$, among the $j$ tagged stations is bounded by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:k_bound}
\max(0,j+d-N) \leq k \leq \min(d,j),
\end{align}
since in a set of $j$ nodes, there cannot be more deterministic stations than the total number of deterministic stations ($k \leq d$), or more random stations than the than the total number of random stations ($j-k \leq N-d$). 


Using (\ref{eq:S_j_def}), (\ref{eq:pAkj}), and (\ref{eq:k_bound}), $S(j)$ can be calculated as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:S_j}
S(j) = &\sum_{k=\max(0,j+d-N)}^{\min(d,j)}   \binom{d}{k} \binom{N-d}{j-k}\\
 & ~~~~~~~~~~~~\times \frac{(B-d)!(B-j)^{N-d-(j-k)}}{\left(B-d-(j-k)\right)!~B^{N-d}}, ~~~ j < N \nonumber 
\end{align}
and for $j=N$,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:S_N}
S(N) = \frac{(B-d)!}{(B-N)!~B^{N-d}}.
\end{align}
Finally, the transition probabilities when $d<N$ can be calculated by replacing $S(j)$ in (\ref{eq:Pij}).


\subsection{Calculating the Number of Steps until Absorption}

To compute the expected number of rounds needed for the solver to reach a solution, we calculate the expected number of transitions that the MC takes to reach the absorbing state $S_N$ (see, e.g., \cite{grinstead1997ip} for the theory behind this calculation).

Let $\Pbf^{B,N}$ be the transition probability matrix of the MC. This matrix is a square matrix of size $N+1$. If we number the rows and columns of $\Pbf^{B,N}$ starting with zero, the element in row $d$ and column $\delta$ is simply $\left[\Pbf^{B,N}\right]_{d,\delta} = p^{B,N}_{d,\delta}$ as in (\ref{eq:Pij}). In this matrix, rows $0$ to $N-1$ represent transitions from the transient states and row $N$ the transitions from the absorbing state. Therefore, $\Pbf^{B,N}$ has the following general form:
\begin{equation} \label{Eq:Pmat_form}
%\offinterlineskip
\Pbf^{B,N} \;= \bordermatrix{
                       &\hbox{TR}  &\omit\hfil &\hbox{ABS}\cr
    \hbox{TR}\bigstrut &\mathbf{Q}_{(N \times N)} &\srule     &\mathbf{c}_{(N \times 1)} \cr
\middlehrule{1}{1}
    \hbox{ABS}\bigstrut&\mathbf{0}_{(1 \times N)} &\srule & 1}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{Q}$ is a matrix containing the first $N$ rows and columns of $\Pbf^{B,N}$, form which we calculate the fundamental matrix of the absorbing MC as $\mathbf{N}= (\mathbf{I}_{N \times N}-\mathbf{Q})^{-1}$, where $\mathbf{I}_{N \times N}$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix.
The expected number of steps to absorption, if the system starts in state $S_0$, is the sum of all the elements in the first row of $\mathbf{N}$.

% Later in the article we will provide a general formula to compute $\psi_{d,\delta}^{B,N}$.
% As a first step, however, we analyze the simpler case in which $d=0$, which means that all the stations are randomly choosing their transmission slot.
% This particular case is considered in Proposition \ref{pro:zero_case}.
% 
% \begin{proposition}
% \label{pro:zero_case}
% The probability $\psi^{B,N}_{d,\delta}$ in the particular case when $d=0$ is
% \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \psi^{B,N}_{0,\delta} & {}={} &\sum_{j=\delta}^{N-1} (-1)^{j+\delta}\binom{j}{\delta} \binom{N}{j}\frac{B! (B-j)^{N-j}}{(B-j)! B^N} \nonumber\\
% &&{+}\:(-1)^{N+\delta}\binom{N}{\delta}\frac{B!}{(B-N)!B^N}.
% \label{eq:psi_zero}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \end{proposition}
% 
% \begin{proof}
% We are considering transitions from the state $S_0$ in which all the stations behave randomly to the other states.
% Our aim is to compute the transition probabilities from $S_0$ to another state $S_\delta$, $0\leq \delta \leq N$, which is the probability that exactly $\delta$ stations successfully transmit.
% Some intermediate steps are necessary to compute the transition probabilities.
% 
% We will define a set of $N$ events which represent the success of each of the $N$ stations and then we consider intersections among these events.
% As an example, to compute the transition from $S_0$ to $S_1$ we need to compute the probability that exactly one of the stations successfully transmits.
% This is a counting problem in which we need to count all the cases in which exactly one of the stations successfully transmit.
% We will use a theorem that addresses this specific problem as we detail in the Appendix.
% 
% We number the stations from $1$ to $N$ for convenience, and we define $A_i$, ($i=1,\cdots,N$) the event that station $i$ succeeds and $\mathbf{A}=\{A_i:i=1,\dots,N\}$ the collection of these events.
% Notice that these events are partially overlapping, since it is possible that more than one station successfully transmits.
% 
% We derive the probability of the event $A_i$ ($i=1\dots N$) as follows:
% the probability that a tagged stations succeeds is simply the probability that the remaining $N-1$ stations choose a different slot from the tagged station.
% As there are a total of $B-1$ of such slots, the probability that all $N-1$ stations choose among those $B-1$ slots out of the total $B$ slots is given by
% \begin{equation}
% P(A_i)=\left(\frac{B-1}{B} \right)^{N-1}.
% \end{equation}
% 
% In the following, we will derive the probability that a selection of $j$ tagged stations succeeds.
% Let $\mathbf{A}^j$ be a set of $j$ ($j\leq N$) events in $\mathbf{A}$, that is $\mathbf{A}^j \subseteq \mathbf{A}, |\mathbf{A}^j|=j$.
% Without loss of generality, and to clarify the explanation, we take the ordered list of the tagged stations and assume that they choose, one by one, from 1 to $j$, the slot in which they transmit.
% The first tagged station chooses any slot.
% The second station chooses any slot different from the one chosen by the first one with probability $(B-1)/B$.
% In general, the $l$-th ($1 \leq l \leq j$) tagged station chooses one of the remaining slots with probability $(B-(l-1))/B$.
% Finally, we need that the remaining $N-j$ non tagged stations (if any) choose the slots that are not occupied by the tagged stations, which occurs with probability $\left( \frac{B-j}{B}\right)^{N-j}$.
% 
% Summing up, for $1 \leq j \leq N-1$ the probability that all the $j$ tagged stations successfully transmit is given by
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:prob_j_sta_transmit}
% P\left( A_\cap \right) = \frac{B}{B} \cdot \frac{B-1}{B} \cdot \dots \cdot \frac{B-(j-1)}{B} \cdot \left( \frac{B-j}{B} \right)^{N-j},
% \end{equation}
% where $A_\cap=\bigcap_{ A_i \in \mathbf{A}^j}A_i$ and $j=1\dots N-1$.
% 
% Rewriting (\ref{eq:prob_j_sta_transmit}), we obtain
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:PA}
% P\left( A_\cap \right) = \frac{B! (B-j)^{N-j}}{(B-j)! B^N},
% \quad j=1\dots N-1.
% \end{equation}
% 
% Now, let us define $S(0,j)$ as the sum of the probabilities of occurrence of all the $\binom{N}{j}$ subsets $\mathbf{A}^j$ of size $|\mathbf{A}^j|=j$. For $j < N$ it is,
% 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \label{eq:S0j}
% S(0,j) & {}={}  & \sum_{\scriptstyle \mathbf{A}^j\subseteq\mathbf{A}} P\left( A_\cap \right) \\
% &{}={}& \sum_{\scriptstyle \mathbf{A}^j\subseteq\mathbf{A}} \binom{N}{j}\frac{B! (B-j)^{N-j}}{(B-j)! B^N},
% \quad j=1 \dots N-1. \nonumber
% \end{eqnarray}
% 
% The expressions for (\ref{eq:PA}) and (\ref{eq:S0j}) in the case that all the stations succeed ($j=N$) are:
% \begin{equation}
% P\left( \bigcap_{ A_i \in \mathbf{A}^N } A_i \right) = \frac{B!}{(B-N)! B^N}
% ,
% \end{equation}
% 
% and
% \begin{eqnarray}
% S(0,N) &{}={}& \sum_{\scriptstyle \mathbf{A}^N\subseteq\mathbf{A}} P\biggl(\bigcap_{A_i\in \mathbf{A}^N} A_i \biggr) \nonumber\\
% &{}={}& \frac{B!}{(B-N)! B^N}.
% \end{eqnarray}
% 
% 
% 
% Finally, we will derive the value of $\psi_{0,n}^{B,N}$ applying the theorem in Sec. IV.3 of \cite{feller1968ipt} as exemplified in the Appendix.
% The result is:
% 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \psi^{B,N}_{0,\delta} &{}={}& \sum_{j=\delta}^{N} (-1)^{j+\delta}\binom{j}{\delta} S(0,j) \nonumber\\
% &{}={}& \sum_{j=\delta}^{N-1} (-1)^{j+\delta}\binom{j}{\delta} \binom{N}{j}\frac{B! (B-j)^{N-j}}{(B-j)! B^N} \nonumber\\
% & & + (-1)^{N+\delta}\binom{N}{\delta}\frac{B!}{(B-N)! B^N}.
% \label{eq:psi_zero}
% \end{eqnarray}
% 
% 
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proposition}
% \label{pro:general_case}
% The probability $\psi^{B,N}_{d,\delta}$ is
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \psi^{B,N}_{d,\delta} & {}={} & \sum_{j=\delta}^{N-1}  (-1)^{j+\delta} \binom{j}{\delta}
% \sum_{i=max(0,j+d-N)}^{min(d,j)} \nonumber\\
% & & \binom{d}{i} \binom{N-d}{j-i}
% \frac{(B-d)! (B-j)^{N-d-(j-i)}}{(B-d-(j-i))! B^{N-d}}
% \nonumber\\
% & & + (-1)^{N+\delta} \binom{N}{\delta} \frac{(B-d)!}{(B-N)!B^{N-d}}
% \label{eq:psi}
% \end{eqnarray}
% \end{proposition}
% 
% \begin{proof}
% We will use a similar notation to the one used for the proof of Proposition~\ref{pro:zero_case}.
% For this general case, we assume that there are $d$ ($0 \leq d \leq N$) stations that are using a deterministic backoff.
% We define $A_i$ ($i=1\dots N$) the event that station $A_i$ succeeds and $\mathbf{A}=\{A_i:i=1. \dots, N \}$ the collection of all these events.
% 
% In the following, we will derive the probability of success $A_i$ ($i=1,\dots ,N$). There are two cases to consider: \emph{c.1} the success probability for a station that has used deterministic backoff and \emph{c.2} the success probability for a station that behaves randomly.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \emph{c.1} The probability that a station that is using a deterministic backoff succeeds is simply the probability that the $N-d$ random stations choose a different slot from the deterministic station under consideration, which is
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:success_deterministic}
% \left( \frac{B-1}{B} \right)^{N-d}.
% \end{equation}
% \item \emph{c.2} The probability that one of the random stations succeeds is the probability that this station chooses an empty slot multiplied by the probability that the remaining $N-d$ random stations choose a different slot, which is
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:success_random}
% \frac{B-d}{B} \cdot \frac{(B-1)^{N-d-1}}{B^{N-d}}
% \quad
% d=0 \dots N-1
% \end{equation}
% Note that since in this case we are considering the probability that a random station succeeds, it is implicit that there is at least one random station and therefore $d$ is smaller than $N$.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% In the following, we will derive the probability that a selection of tagged station succeeds.
% Let $\mathbf{A}^j$ be a set of $j$ events in $\mathbf{A}$, that is, $\mathbf{A}^j \subseteq \mathbf{A}$ and $|\mathbf{A}|=j$.
% Let us define $S(d,j)$ as the sum of the probabilities of occurrence of all of the subsets $A^j$ of size $|\mathbf{A}^j|=j$.
% 
% For $j=1$ we are considering subsets of size 1.
% There are $N$ of such subsets.
% $d$ of them contain a deterministic station while the remaining $N-d$ contain a random station.
% Using (\ref{eq:success_deterministic}) and (\ref{eq:success_random}) we derive $S(d,1)$:
% \begin{equation}
% S(d,1)=d \left( \frac{B-1}{B} \right)^{N-d} + (N-d)\cdot \frac{B-1}{B}\cdot \frac{(B-1)^{N-d-1}}{B^{N-d}}.
% \end{equation}
% 
% The right hand side summand is equal to zero when $d=N$.
% 
% In order to compute $S(d,j)$ for any value of $j$, $0 \leq j \leq N$, we need to consider all the possible subsets $\mathbf{A}^j$ with $j$ stations, and for each one compute the probability that all of the stations in the subset succeed.
% For convenience, we say that a subset succeeds when all the stations in the subset succeed.
% As the success probability of the stations is different for case \emph{c.1} and case \emph{c.2}, subsets of the same size can have different success probabilities depending on the number of deterministic and random stations that is considered in the subset.
% It is necessary to take into account not only the size of the subset, but also the number of deterministic stations considered in each subset.
% We will capture this number of deterministic stations in a new upper index.
% 
% Let us consider a generic subset $\mathbf{A}^{k,j}$ of $j$ stations, $|\mathbf{A}^{k,j}|=j$.
% Out of the $j$ stations, there are $k$ deterministic stations and $j-k$ random stations.
% As we are assuming that there are $d$ deterministic stations out of the total $N$ stations in the system, the following constraints must be satisfied:
% \begin{equation}
% 0 \leq k \leq d,
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% 0 \leq j-k \leq N -d.
% \end{equation}
% 
% And, consequently,
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:ineq1}
%  k \leq j,
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:ineq2}
%  j-N+d \leq k.
% \end{equation}
% 
% From (\ref{eq:ineq1}) and (\ref{eq:ineq2}) the following bounds are obtained for $k$:
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:bounds}
% max(0,j+d-N) \leq k \leq min(d,j).
% \end{equation}
% 
% In the following, we will derive the probability that a set of $\mathbf{A}^{k,j}$ tagged stations succeeds.
% The probability that $k$ out of the total $d$ deterministic stations and $j-k$ out of the total $N-d$ random stations succeed is the probability that the $j-k$ stations choose unoccupied slots and the remaining $N-d-(j-k)$random stations choose slots that are different from the $j$ successful stations.
% The first part occurs with probability $\frac{(B-d)!}{\left(B-d-(j-k) \right)!B^{j-k}}$  , and the second with probability $\left(\frac{B-j}{B} \right)^{N-d-(j-k)}$.
% Consequently, the probability that all of the $j$ stations of $\mathbf{A}^{j,k}$ succeed is given by
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:pakj}
% P(\mathbf{A}^{j})
% = \frac{(B-d)!\left( \frac{B-j}{B} \right)^{N-d-(j-k)}}{(B-d-(j-k))!B^{j-k}}
% \end{equation}
% where $j=0\dots N-1$.
% The particular case $j=N$ implies that $k=d$.
% Consequently,
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:padN}
% P(\mathbf{A}^{d,N})=\frac{(B-d)!}{(B-N)!B^{N-d}},
% \end{equation}
% 
% Combining (\ref{eq:bounds}), (\ref{eq:pakj}) and (\ref{eq:padN}) we obtain, for $j=1 \dots N-1$,
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \label{eq:sdj}
% S(d,j) & {}={} & \sum_{k=max(0,j+d-N)}^{min(d,j)} \binom{d}{k} \binom{N-d}{j-k} \nonumber\\
% && \frac{(B-d)!\left(\frac{B-j}{B} \right)^{N-d-(j-k)}}{\left(B-d-(j-k)\right)!B^{j-k}}
% \end{eqnarray}
% 
% and
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:sdN}
% S(d,N)= \frac{(B-d)!}{(B-N)!B^{j-d}}.
% \end{equation}
% 
% Note that for $d=0$ we obtain the value $S(0,j)$ introduced in Proposition \ref{pro:zero_case}, where all the stations randomly selected their transmission slot.
% 
% We will use the theorem in Sec. IV.3 of \cite{feller1968ipt} which states that
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:theorem}
% \psi^{B,N}_{d,\delta} = \sum_{j=\delta}^{N} (-1)^{j+\delta}\binom{j}{\delta} S(d,j).
% \end{equation}
% 
% The result follows from substituting (\ref{eq:sdj}) and (\ref{eq:sdN}) in (\ref{eq:theorem}).
% 
% \end{proof}

\label{fig:convergence_avg}
\end{figure}


In this section we present simulation results that validate the expressions derived in the previous section.
The simulation scenario is exactly the one described in Sect. \ref{sec:markov_chain}.
The number of slots in each round is set to $B=8$ and $B=16$, and the number of contenders $N$ takes values from 2 to 16.
The contenders choose the same slot in the case of successful transmission and a random slot if the transmission is unsuccessful.

The first results are for an ideal channel that does not introduce errors.
We compare the analytically computed expected number of steps to absorption and the average number of steps to reach collision-free operation obtained from 10,000 executions of a custom simulator in c.\footnote{The two simulators in C that we have used and the scripts in maxima to compute the expectations derived from the analytical model can be downloaded from www.jaumebarcelo.info/papers/barcelo-macom2012-sources.zip .}
The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:convergence_avg}.

To offer further insight on the convergence process, we also compute the 5-th, 25-th, 50-th, 75-th and 95-th percentiles of the number of steps to absorption for the case $B=16$, which are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:convergence_stats}.
These percentiles provide an idea of the distribution of the value of the number steps required to reach collision-free operation.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Results in the presence of channel errors}
So far we have not considered the possibility that the channel introduced errors.
In the case of channel error, a transmission may be unsuccessful even if it has not suffered a collision.
An erroneous transmission has the same effect of a collided one and a station that suffers a channel error will randomly select a slot in the next transmission round.

The probability of moving from the state $S_d$ to the state $S_\delta$ when a channel error happens with probability $\epsilon$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:psiBNepsilon}
p^{B,N,\epsilon}_{d,\delta}= p^{B,N}_{d,\delta} (1-\epsilon)^\delta + \sum_{i=\delta+1}^{N} \binom{i}{\delta} \epsilon^{i-\delta}(1-\epsilon)^\delta p^{B,N}_{d,i}.
\end{equation}
In other words, the probability that there are exactly $\delta$ successful stations is the probability that there are $\delta$ stations that do not collide and none of them suffers a collision plus the probability that there are $i$ ($\delta < i \leq N$) stations that do not collide and exactly $i-\delta$ of those stations suffer a collision.
Note that the resulting MC is no longer absorbing.
In this case, to validate the expression in (\ref{eq:psiBNepsilon}) we compute the average number of successful transmissions in each step from the MC and compare it with averages obtained from a simulation of 10,000 rounds.
The results for a channel error probability $\epsilon=0.1$, different numbers of slots ($B$) and different numbers of contenders ($N$) are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:successful_tx_per_step}.

\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{figures/successful_tx_per_step}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have studied a Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) problem solver to assign channel slots to contending stations.
The stations deterministically choose their transmission slots after successful transmissions.
If the transmission is not successful, the station randomly chooses its next transmission slot.
The system eventually converges to collision-free operation in ideal channel conditions.

We have modeled the convergence process as a MC and have derived closed expressions for the transition probabilities.
These values can be used to compute the expected number of steps required for the system to converge to a solution.

We have also considered the possibility of the presence of channel errors and constructed the MC that accounts for channel errors, which is no longer an absorbing MC.

The presented results have been validated by means of simulation.

\section{Generalized Inclusion Exclusion Illustration}
\label{app:incl-excl-thm}
\label{app:theorem}
The theorem we use is named ``The realization of $m$ among $N$ events'' and it is presented in \cite{feller1968ipt} in Sec. IV.3.
Following our notation, we are interested in computing the probability that exactly $m=\delta$ among the $N$ stations succeed.

\begin{figure}
\psfrag{A1}[cc][cc]{$A_1$}
\psfrag{A2}[cc][cc]{$A_2$}
\psfrag{A3}[cc][cc]{$A_3$}

\includegraphics[height=3cm]{figures/counting}
\caption{Illustration of the counting problem}
\label{fig:counting}
\end{figure}

To illustrate the underlying idea we will use a simple example involving $N=3$ different stations choosing among $B=4$ different slots.
We assume that the number of stations deterministically choosing its transmission slot is $d=0$ and we are interested in computing the probability that exactly $\delta=1$ station succeeds.

There are a total of $B^N=4^3$ outcomes that are represented as black dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:counting}.
Each outcome is equally likely with probability $1/64$.
The figure also shows three events $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$.
The first event, $A_1$ represents the outcomes in which the first station succeeds.
Similarly, the other two events, $A_2$ and $A_3$, represent the outcomes in which station 2 and 3 succeed, respectively.
These sets are partially overlapping.
Note also that it is impossible that two stations succeed while the third station collides.

If we want to compute the probability that exactly one station succeeds, we have to count the outcomes that belong to either $A_1$, $A_2$ or $A_3$ and are not part of the intersections.
This is $|A_1|+|A_2|+|A_3|-2(|A_1\cap A_2|+|A_1\cap A_3|+|A_2\cap A_3|)+3(|A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3|)$.
In our paper we will use the intermediate values
 $S(0,1)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)$,
 $S(0,2)=P(A_1\cap A_2)+P(A_1\cap A_3)+P(A_2\cap A_3)$, and $S(0,3)=P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)$.
 The probability that exactly one station succeeds is finally computed  as $S(0,1)-2S(0,2)+3S(0,3)$.
